# Ball-sort-game
## Overview
this is project was built as fun learning path to the most famous sorting algorithms, ball sort is a game where you have number of tubes and number of colored ballsso the goal is to let these algorithm sort the colored balls in the tubes until all balls with the same color stay in the same tube<br>
you can play the normal game from this link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GMA.Ball.Sort.Puzzle&hl=en_US&gl=US

## What this Project contains:
1- CLI representation of the gamePlay.<br>
2- You can choose between several Sorting algorithm and compare between them in time and complexty needed to solve the game instance .<br>
### Depth first search:
is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
### breadth first search:
is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
### Uniform-Cost Search:
is a variant of Dijikstraâ€™s algorithm. Here, instead of inserting all vertices into a priority queue, we insert only source, then one by one insert when needed. In every step, we check if the item is already in priority queue (using visited array). If yes, we perform decrease key, else we insert it. 
### hill climbing:
It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution.
### Astar:
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.
## How to use this project:
This project was implemented with C++ programming language and CodeBlocks IDE so you can clone this repo and use it with any IDE that supports C++<br>
note:text files are used as initil state of them game
## Contribution and  Contact info:
 I'm happy if anyone wants to contribute to this repo (a GUI would be Great for  visualization ;))<br>
